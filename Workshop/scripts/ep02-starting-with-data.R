# Based on: https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/02-starting-with-data.html



# Lets download some data (make sure the data folder exists)
download.file(url = "https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/2292169",
              destfile = "data_raw/portal_data_joined.csv")

# now we will read this "csv" into an R object called "surveys"
surveys <- read.csv("data_raw/portal_data_joined.csv")

# and take a look at it
surveys
head(surveys)    #shows you the top of the table
View(surveys)

# BTW, we assumed our data was comma separated, however this might not
# always be the case. So we may been to tell read.csv more about our file.



# So what kind of an R object is "surveys" ?
class(surveys)


# ok - so what are dataframes ?
str(surveys)    #tells us all the meta information that R knows about "surveys"
dim(surveys)    #tells us the dimensions of the data
nrow(surveys)   #tells you the number of rows
ncol(surveys)   #tells you the number of columns

head(surveys, 2)  #lets you control how many rows it shows
summary(surveys)  #gives you a bunch of statistics about the data

# --------
# Exercise
# --------
#
# What is the class of the object surveys?
# 
# Answer:
# dataframe

# How many rows and how many columns are in this survey ?
#
# Answer:
# rows: 34786, columns: 13

# What's the average weight of survey animals
#
#
# Answer:
mean(surveys$weight, na.rm = TRUE)
# 42.67243
# or find it in the summary function

# Are there more Birds than Rodents ?
#
#
# Answer: nope


# 
# Topic: Sub-setting
#

# first element in the first column of the data frame (as a vector)
surveys[1,1]

# first element in the 6th column (as a vector)
surveys[1,6]

# first column of the data frame (as a vector)
surveys[, 1]

# first column of the data frame (as a data frame)


# first row (as a data frame)


# first three elements in the 7th column (as a vector)


# the 3rd row of the data frame (as a data.frame)


# equivalent to head(metadata)


# looking at the 1:6 more closely


# we also use other objects to specify the range



#
# Challenge: Using slicing, see if you can produce the same result as:
#
#   tail(surveys)
#
# i.e., print just last 6 rows of the surveys dataframe
#
# Solution:



# We can omit (leave out) columns using '-'



# column "names" can be used in place of the column numbers



#
# Topic: Factors (for categorical data)
#


# factors have an order


# Converting factors


# can be tricky if the levels are numbers


# so does our survey data have any factors


#
# Topic:  Dealing with Dates
#

# R has a whole library for dealing with dates ...



# R can concatenated things together using paste()


# 'sep' indicates the character to use to separate each component


# paste() also works for entire columns


# let's save the dates in a new column of our dataframe surveys$date 


# and ask summary() to summarise 


# but what about the "Warning: 129 failed to parse"
